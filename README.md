# Project Neighborly Backend

Project Neighborly's backend powers a platform that connects users needing household chores, neighbors (helpers) offering assistance, and admins managing operations. Built with Express.js and MongoDB, it uses JWT for secure authentication, Stripe for safe payments, and Socket.IO for real-time messaging. Designed with clean architecture, it provides scalable, secure APIs for chore matching, bookings, admin tasks, and reviews.
